# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview
This is a simple browser console-based JavaScript app in which you can play 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' against the computer. After 5 rounds, the result of the game is announced.

## Game-play
1. Start a new game: enter **game()** into the console
2. The computer will make its selection
3. You'll be asked for your selection: enter only either 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors' into the prompt, case insensitive.
  - if you enter invalid text, you'll be prompted to reenter valid text
  - if you cancel the prompt, you'll be asked if you wish to continue the game. If you press cancel, the game will exit.
4. This will repeat for 5 rounds
5. At the end, you'll be told whether you won, lost, or tied with the computer.
